# Project 2 - ETL

## Project Proposal

Does Elon tweeting or does the reaction he receives on Twitter have a larger impact on trading volume and ticker price for the companies he owns? 

Use twitter to look at Elon Musk’s tweets for mentions of Tesla or Twitter, find Boolean answers for if those companies are mentioned or not and the dates of the tweets. Also search all of twitter for mentions of those companies for a comparison of activity to see if Elon’s tweets affected overall buzz or activity around the companies. 

Pull aggregate trading data from Quandl Finance API and match to twitter data to analyze the impact of Elon tweets & aggregate tweet volume on his companies’ stock price, trading volume, and any other financial data of interest.  

We plan to load the data into a relational database to perform our final analysis.
